## Project objective

* add tests to all the bugs you find
* add tests to working features, if you think that a given functionality is important for the user
* create a show-off setup, but don't overdo it
    * use all the latest and greatest tools you know
    * use all the techniquest you are aware of that fit this assignment
* use TypeScript if possible (if not use JavaScript)
* save your work in a git repo (with some nice, readable commits)
